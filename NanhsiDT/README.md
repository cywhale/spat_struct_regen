## R package about datasets and functions used in Nanhsi Forest Dynamics Plot related researches.

> The NanhsiDT package provides datasets including seedling, and understory species assemblages. Temporarily, this is only a trial-version, providing some funtions to manipulate composition(site-variable) data.

> The package will be updated and improved while our research progressing. I'll also release source codes later.

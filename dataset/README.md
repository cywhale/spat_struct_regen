tmp_ssn_topography.RData
save intermediate results of topographic factors in this paper (utopo: topograpic factors of understory grids used in variation partitioning; trx: some additional information shared between tree subplots and understory sampling sites; 10 m x 10m projected on 2 m x 2m). Results from 01_terrainPlot.Rmd

tmp_PCNM_us.RData
save intermeidate, time-consuming results of PCNM (MEMs) and forward-selection in 01S_Tab1_spatialPCNM.Rmd

tmp_biofac_us.RData
sav intermediate (neighborhood) bio-factors in understory, from 01S_Tab1_spatialPCNM.rmd. (u.site: site name in transects and x,y-coordinates of understory sites, uscov: us cover data, tnc: tree BA and density, sx.env.red: significant topographic factors to variations in seedling assemblages; ukm.red, understory-plant spatial structure, ukm.ax, ukm.red projected on first RDA axis, partialling out topographic effects. xres.h, xsdl.h, sdl.new, ush.h: compositions of understory or seedlings, .h means hellinger transformed)

**Study area**

1. Location: Nanhsi forest dynamics plot (FDP), with an area of 8.37 ha and elevations ranging from 1,960 to 2,060 m (Fig. 1). The plot is located in a bio-reserve of the Yushan National Park, mid-southern Taiwan (120°54' 17" E, 23°27' 32" N). 

2. Climate: characterized by a daily regular cloud immersion and seasonal precipitation. Typhoons and accompanying southwesterly winds can cause extremely heavy rainfall. The mean annual rainfall was about 3,044 mm (during 1998-2009), and 77% of the precipitation occurred from May to September. The mean annul temperature was 11.5 °C (1998-2009), with a January mean of 6.7°C and July mean of 14.9°C. 

**Forest vegetation**

> The forest vegetation in this plot was dominated by evergreen broadleaved tree species, which was equivalent to the “Quercus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest” defined in Li et al. (2013).

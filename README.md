**Study area**
> The study was conducted in the Nanhsi forest dynamics plot (FDP), with an area of 8.37 ha and elevations ranging from 1,960 to 2,060 m (Fig. 1). The plot is located in a bio-reserve of the Yushan National Park, mid-southern Taiwan (120°54' 17" E, 23°27' 32" N). The climate is characterized by a daily regular cloud immersion and seasonal precipitation. Typhoons and accompanying southwesterly winds can cause extremely heavy rainfall. The mean annual rainfall was about 3,044 mm (during 1998-2009), and 77% of the precipitation occurred from May to September. The mean annul temperature was 11.5 °C (1998-2009), with a January mean of 6.7°C and July mean of 14.9°C. 

**Forest vegetation**
> The forest vegetation in this plot was dominated by evergreen broadleaved tree species, which was equivalent to the “Quercus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest” defined in Li et al. (2013). According to the tree demography censused in 2006 (Yang et al. 2008), there were 18,766 trees (with diameter at breast height, dbh ≥ 1 cm) belonging to 27 families, 49 genera and 65 species. The dominant families were Lauraceae, Fagaceae and Theaceae (whose members of Eurya spp. had moved into Pentaphylacaceae in Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system). Top five dominant species were Castanopsis cuspidata (Castanopsis carlesii, the synonym in Yang et al., 2008), Machilus japonica, Listea acuminate, Cyclobalanopsis stenophylloides and Pasania kawakamii. Forest vegetation types identified in this plot included two Lauraceae-dominated forest types (M. japonica type and M. japonica-C. cuspidata type), one Theaceae-Fagaceae forest type (Schima superba-C. cuspidata type), and one deciduous forest type (Alnus formosana type).
